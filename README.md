# Data Structures in Java

A collection of common data structures implemented in Java, including:

- ArrayList
- Linked List
  - Single Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Single Linked List
  - Circular Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Set
- Binary Search Tree

Search and Sort Algorithms

-Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
Each algorithm has its own Python file in the repository. The files are named according to the algorithm they implement.

To use any of the algorithms, simply import the corresponding function from

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE
3. Explore and run the examples to understand the implementation of each data structure

## ArrayList

A dynamic data structure that can store an unlimited number of elements, implemented as a resizable array.

## Linked List

A linear structure where elements point to the next/previous element, offering constant-time insertions/deletions.

## Stack

A last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure with constant-time access, insertions, and deletions.

## Queue

A first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure with constant-time access, insertions, and deletions.

## Set

A collection of unique elements, with operations for adding, removing, and checking for membership.

## Binary Search Tree

A tree structure where each node has a value that is greater than all the values in its left sub-tree and less than all the values in its right sub-tree.

- Types of Traversals:
  - In-Order
  - Pre-Order
  - Post-Order
  - Level Order
  - Depth Order
