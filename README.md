# Data Structures in Java

A collection of common data structures implemented in Java, including:

- ArrayList
- Linked List
  - Single Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Single Linked List
  - Circular Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Set
- Binary Search Tree

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE
3. Explore and run the examples to understand the implementation of each data structure

## ArrayList

A dynamic data structure that can store an unlimited number of elements, implemented as a resizable array.

## Linked List

A linear structure where elements point to the next/previous element, offering constant-time insertions/deletions.

## Stack

A last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure with constant-time access, insertions, and deletions.

## Queue

A first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure with constant-time access, insertions, and deletions.

## Set

A collection of unique elements, with operations for adding, removing, and checking for membership.

## Binary Search Tree

A tree structure where each node has a value that is greater than all the values in its left sub-tree and less than all the values in its right sub-tree.

- Types of Traversals:
  - In-Order
  - Pre-Order
  - Post-Order
  - Level Order
  - Depth Order
